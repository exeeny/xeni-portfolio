This website was HEAVILY inspired by Sharlene Yap (https://www.sharyap.com/) so i decided to remade it. No code was stolen(actually idk how to do that) so i implement all the logic by myself using some packages. I don't claim to be a professional, i did what i knew and what i intuitivelly decided to do so here i am.
